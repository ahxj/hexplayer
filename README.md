## Warning:
When you encounter "hexplayer.app cannot be opened because it is from an unidentified developer," don't worry - this happens because the software is not signed. Go to "System Preferences," select "Security & Privacy," and click "Open Anyway."

Why isn't it signed? - Because I don't want to pay for a certificate ($99 per year).

Concerned about security? - The code is open source - feel free to compile it yourself.

Hex Player uses AVFoundation for audio decoding, supporting most common audio formats. To maintain software simplicity, no additional decoding libraries are integrated, therefore:

- Some uncommon formats like opus, ogg, etc. may have compatibility issues
- For broader format support, consider using players with integrated third-party decoding libraries like ffmpeg
